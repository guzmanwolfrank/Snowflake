# Snowflake Data Analysis Project

This project is aimed at performing data analysis on transactions stored in a Snowflake database. It involves uploading transaction data from a CSV file into a Snowflake table, executing SQL queries to analyze the data, and displaying the results.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Upload transaction data from a CSV file into a Snowflake table.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform various data analysis tasks using SQL queries on the Snowflake database.
- **Result Visualization**: Display the results of the data analysis queries.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `snowflake-connector-python` library
- `pandas` library

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/snowflake-data-analysis.git
    cd snowflake-data-analysis
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install snowflake-connector-python pandas
    ```

3. Update Snowflake connection parameters:

    Open the `snowflake_script.py` file and replace the placeholders (`<your_user>`, `<your_password>`, `<your_account>`, etc.) with your actual Snowflake credentials.

## Usage

1. Run the `snowflake_script.py` script to upload the CSV file to a Snowflake table, execute the predefined SQL queries, and print the results:

    ```bash
    python snowflake_script.py
    ```
